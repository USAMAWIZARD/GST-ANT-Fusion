h264 file is divided into nal units
A frame can be sliced into several NALU
one or more NALU grouped togethehr called AU that contains a single frame

nal units are of diffrent catagories vcl non vcl

vcl - contians frame data
non vlc - contains meta data that may be used for setting decoders

there 18 diffrent type of nal unitys
first byte of each NALU contains its type
Each NALU start with 0

important NALU types 
**sps**  non-vcl configure decoder profile level res / fps (imporant for decoders)
**pps**  non-vcl motioin predection and filter (importatant for decoders)
**IDR**  VCL contains key frame

0 Unspecified non-VCL
1 Coded slice of a non-IDR picture VCL
2 Coded slice data partition A VCL
3 Coded slice data partition B VCL
4 Coded slice data partition C VCL
5 Coded slice of an IDR picture VCL
6 Supplemental enhancement information (SEI) non-VCL
7 Sequence parameter set non-VCL
8 Picture parameter set non-VCL
9 Access unit delimiter non-VCL
10 End of sequence non-VCL
11 End of stream non-VCL
12 Filler data non-VCL
13 Sequence parameter set extension non-VCL
14 Prefix NAL unit non-VCL
15 Subset sequence parameter set non-VCL
16..18 Reserved non-VCL
19 Coded slice of an auxiliary coded picture without partitioning non-VCL
20 Coded slice extension non-VCL
21 Coded slice extension for depth view components non-VCL
22..23 Reserved non-VCL
24..31 Unspecified non-VCL

NALU does not contains its size
therefore concatinating NALUs will not work
How to know where each one starts and ends

Therefore
we use Statcode before each NALU
Start Code :- 2 or 3 byte 0x00 followed by 0x01 byte  00 00 00 01 OR  00 00 01
4 byte version is used for SPS PPS AUD and IDR
`0x000000`, `0x000001` and `0x000002` are illegal within a NALU
 encoder escape these values that could otherwise be confused with a start code
Each NALU start with 0 (BIT) 
Emulation Prevention’ byte 0x03, so that 0x000001 becomes 0x00000301

Common H264 NALU Formating 
Annex B  (used in live streaming)
SPS and PPS periodically repeted 
usually proceeding every IDR
This enables the ability to join a stream already in progress

AVCC  (used in local storing )
each nalu is stored preceeding witth its leangth 
Easy to  store  & parse
